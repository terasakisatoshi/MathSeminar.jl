  Chisq(ν)

  The Chi squared distribution (typically written χ²) with ν degrees of
  freedom has the probability density function

  f(x; \nu) = \frac{x^{\nu/2 - 1} e^{-x/2}}{2^{\nu/2} \Gamma(k/2)}, \quad x > 0.

  If ν is an integer, then it is the distribution of the sum of squares of ν
  independent standard Normal variates.

  Chisq(ν)     # Chi-squared distribution with ν degrees of freedom
  
  params(d)    # Get the parameters, i.e. (ν,)
  dof(d)       # Get the degrees of freedom, i.e. ν
